As a global travel technology company, we recognize our responsibility to ensure ethical practices throughout our business and value chain.
      
      Modern slavery is a crime and violation of fundamental human rights. It takes various forms such as slavery, servitude, forced and compulsory labor, and human trafficking, all of which involve the deprivation of a person's liberty for the purpose of exploitation.
      
      AirconTrip has a zero-tolerance approach to modern slavery. We are committed to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business dealings and relationships, and to implementing and enforcing effective systems and controls to ensure modern slavery is not taking place anywhere in our own operations or in our supply chains.`
